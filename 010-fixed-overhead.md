# The Fixed Overhead

18F carries a fixed, $12M overhead from the GSA.

This does not seem particularly negotiable. Therefore, **the path to cost recovery for 18F involves earning back this $12M each budget year**.

We drop the months of December and January from this set of estimations, because so much of government (essentially) "shuts down" during this time. 

Put another way, **we assume a 10-month financial year** when we calculate things like "how much work can we do?," but we assume a 12-month year when we consider things like "how much do staff cost?"
